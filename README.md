# Dark theme for Jupyter notebook (iPython 4)

This is a fully dark theme for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook interface, including the notebook list, dialogs, and menus. Jupyter includes iPython 4 as its default kernel. It is possible to upgrade iPython 2 or 3 to Jupyter.

Source code coloring is based on the Twilight theme for Textmate.

## Installing

To install this theme, copy or symlink `custom.css` into `~/.jupyter/custom/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist.) Then, running `jupyter notebook`, `iruby notebook`, etc. will use this theme.
