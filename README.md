# Dark theme for Jupyter notebook (iPython 4)

This is a fully dark theme for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook interface, including the notebook list, dialogs, and menus. Jupyter includes iPython 4 as its default kernel. It is possible to upgrade iPython 2 or 3 to Jupyter.

Source code coloring is based on the Twilight theme for Textmate.
